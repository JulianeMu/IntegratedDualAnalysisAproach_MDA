# IntegratedDualAnalysisAproach_MDA

This project includes an integrated dual analysis approach for high-dimensional quantitative and qualitative data. 
The original idea is based on the dual analysis approach developed by Turkay et al. [1]. By treating both, dimensions and items, 
as first order objects, users can obtain an overview about the data and identify possible correlations by investigating changes 
among descriptive statistics after subset selection.
